# BikeSharingMultipleLinearRegression
In this simple project, we are looking for the number of people who would book a bike from a company with respect to provided data. In this project we look through our dataset and with basic feature engineering, make sure to pass validate data to the model. Then we try different models by checking VIF and choose the best linear regression model.
